This repo consist of implementation of BST using array and linked list. Array representation is done by Aarati Shah (roll no.: 60) 
and linked list representation is done by Aarush Timalsina(roll no.: 61).

This is the new repo we have made because our old repo had the commitments made by some other students due to gobal config username and email setting in lab.
